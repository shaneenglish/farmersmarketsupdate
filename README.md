# farmersmarketsupdate
Alyssa Pagano &amp; Shane English update their farmers' market article

1. Alyssa and I found the list of farmers' markets in NYC that accept EBT
2. We created a spreadsheet with the addresses, names, and hours of operation.
3. We cleaned up the data, making sure that the information was uniform throughout each column, imported the data into CartoDB and added the lat/long.
4. We overlaid the locations of the farmers' markets on top of a map that shows the percentage of households receiving SNAP benefits by PUMA.
5. We adjusted the colors of the map so that it was pleasant to look at. 
6. We presented our work to the class. 
7.  We were happy with our map but decided to add additional information to the accompanying article.
8. We added to github (success pending)/shanemenglish.com
